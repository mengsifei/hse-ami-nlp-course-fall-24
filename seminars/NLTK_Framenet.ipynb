FrameNet is based on a theory of meaning called Frame Semantics, deriving from the work of Charles J. Fillmore and colleagues. The basic idea is straightforward: that the meanings of most words can best be understood on the basis of a semantic frame: a description of a type of event, relation, or entity and the participants in it. For example, the concept of cooking typically involves a person doing the cooking (Cook), the food that is to be cooked (Food), something to hold the food while cooking (Container) and a source of heat (Heating_instrument). In the FrameNet project, this is represented as a frame called Apply_heat, and the Cook, Food, Heating_instrument and Container are called frame elements (FEs). Words that evoke this frame, such as fry, bake, boil, and broil, are called lexical units (LUs) of the Apply_heat frame. The job of FrameNet is to define the frames and to annotate sentences to show how the FEs fit syntactically around the word that evokes the frame."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"5YW5fTzp6J96"},"source":["## Frames"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"SWGzo2pL6J99"},"source":["A Frame is a script-like conceptual structure that describes a particular type of situation, object, or event along with the participants and props that are needed for that Frame.

An example is the \"Revenge\" frame which inherits from the \"Rewards_and_punishments\" frame.\n","- Using: The child frame presupposes the parent frame as background, e.g the \"Speed\" frame \"uses\" (or presupposes) the \"Motion\" frame; however, not all parent FEs need to be bound to child FEs.\n","- Subframe: The child frame is a subevent of a complex event represented by the parent, e.g. the \"Criminal_process\" frame has subframes of \"Arrest\", \"Arraignment\", \"Trial\", and \"Sentencing\".\n","- Perspective_on: The child frame provides a particular perspective on an un-perspectivized parent frame.
